## How It Works

The app calculates password strength using:
  * Length of the password
  * Inclusion of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  * Common patterns or weak password checks

Strength levels:
  * Weak: Short or predictable passwords
  * Medium: Moderate complexity, partially safe
  * Strong: Long, complex, and secure
